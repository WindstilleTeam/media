== Sprite

Simple rectangular sprite that is rotabable and scaleable.

{{{
Sprite {
  Vector2f position;
  float    rotation;
  float    scale;
}
}}}

== Simple Quad

Same as sprite, except that its four vertices can be moved
independently around.

{{{
Quad {
  Vector2f position[4];
}
}}}

== Textured Quad

A quad that is filled with a repeating textured.

{{{
TexturedQuad {
  Vector2f position[4];

  float    texture_rotation;
  float    texture_scale;
  Vector2f texture_offset;
}
}}}

== Rope

A series of points that is connected by a thick textured line to
represent ropes or pipes. Begin/end could use seperate textures.

{{{
Rope {
  Vector2f position[N];
  float    thickness;
}
}}}

== Group

Groups allow docking multiple primitives together.

{{{
Group {
  DrawingPrimitives primitives[N];
  float rotation;
  float scale;
}
