== Startup/menu screens ==

On startup the game should present its logo (Windstille), a short list of credits and copyright, combined by some fade-overs and light effects, after that it should fade over to the main menu.

The main menu should offer the user different save-slots from which he can select one, a exit button and an option menu. A bonus would be the function to rewatch cutscenes and dialog via a special menu.

An option menu should allow to tweak the standard meta-game options, volume, fullscreen/window mode, language, controlls (important!) and such. The option menu should be available from inside the game as well.

== Saving the game ==

Saving will be based on slots, not files, when the user enters an empty slot a new game starts, if he enters a non-empty slot the game will continue at the last save-point. Saving will be mostly automatic.

The game will save automatically when you quit and will offer a continue button in the menu that brings you back to where you quit.

== Respawning ==

Its not yet clear how respawing should be handled, one way would be that the player respawns in a hospital in the city when he is critically hurt (GTA-like), another solution would be to simply respawn at the last rooms entrance (Beyond Good&Evil).

== New game ==

Before starting a new game it might be wise to force the user to configure its input, else the game itself might get confusing. 

Once the user starts a new game a scrolling text which gives a general introduction about the backstory of the game is presented. When the text runs out the game fades into the start of the game.
