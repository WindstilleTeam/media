"Jane is using a VR training program for physical therapy now (first mission in milestone2)." - Don't you mean milestone1?

:There already was a playable Windstille release, actually two, however the first couldn't be called playable. So its more like Milestone2 or Milestone3, Milestone2 probally fitting better. Anyway, we are aiming for a real title, not just Milestone XY, ie. something like "Windstille - The Beginning", "Windstille - Hard live on Alpha Prime" or whatever.

::I've always been calling this release Milestone1, so please forgive me for any misnomers I may have perpetuated.  We should come up with at least a working name though, because all these arbitrary milestone numbers are going to get confusing.
