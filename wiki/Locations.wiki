Windstille will have basically two kinds of areas, one is the city, in which one can move around by train or other means, and the other are the outdoor areas which will be reachable mainly by shuttle. 

The outdoor areas will mostly feature powersuit gameplay and revolve around mines, cave and other installations that will allow some room for vertical exploration.

== VR Training

* used for the optional opening tutorial

* provides a number of sub rooms to allow the player to train all kinds of stuff

== City

=== Jane's apartment

=== Street / roof tops

<<note>>
Maybe we will have a sector that just represents walking about the city? I don't know.
<</note>>

=== Bar

Used for meeting some of the characters, perhaps you may go here for jobs, or whatever.

=== Train station

The Train station will be one of the main ways to move around in the city or between different cities.

=== Shuttle port

Where you get on shuttles to take you away from the city

== Forest

=== Above ground

Will contain trees, and maybe some swamp or something too. The idea seems to be that on the forest surface your enemies are the local wildlife, not humans or aliens or whatever. The final boss is a huge spider (though they could be put below ground, see below)

=== Underground

Both man made mines and natural caves. Quite possibly it will contain some robots of various sorts for bad guys, perhaps also spiders.
