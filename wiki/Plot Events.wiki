While the [[Plot]] page goes already into the dialog and the details, this page should focus more on the overall structure, the events that happen and less on how each and every character reacts to them. As with all plot stuff nothing is really set in stone and you are welcome to add your ideas to the [[Ideas]] page or to the Discussion one of this page if you prefer.

* Jane gets wounded in some incident, Jane recovers some days/weeks later (this is where the game starts)

* Miner gets lost in the wood, Jane retrieves him, big Spider involved in this incident (This event is used to explain a bit that the terraforming caused all sorts of weird new creatures)

* A resource freighter crashes down on Zeta-12 shortly after take-off, crash happens near the coast freighter is half flooded (freighter crashdown could be shown via surveillance camera and some dialog via radio)

* Jane investigates the incident and shall recover the blackbox, gets attacked by unknown creature (a out of control devense system inside the freighter could give the player additional throuble, other dangers could be damaged power wires, water and such, unknown creature should be boss-fight like, in the end Jane should get seperated by the creature due to some explosion or so, fight might happen in large parts in the dark)

* unknown creature spreads and causes incidents in some areas over the pass of some weeks/month (radio reports, news)

* Jane tries to find such a creature alive

* some more details about the creatures get know after the retrieval of a lifing one (creatures used to life underground and might have been originally native to the planet, terraforming changed them and mining set them free, which is why they ended up on the freighter)

* outpost in which the creature is hold gets attacked and overrun

* Jane goes to investigate again

* Radar shows that creatures move closer to the city

* Jane needs to stop creatures

* End of this Milestone?
