A Prefab ist a pre-fabricated game-object or a group prefabricated game-objects. The purpose of a Prefab is to easily place a multiple component object. For example a trashcan might consists of both a sprite, a gameobjects which represent a few flies that fly around it and some other items. So job of a prefab would know we to encapsule this complex object and offer it to the user in the level editor as a single easy to use object.

== Prefab Definition Files ==

All prefab need to be defined in a file so that the editor can find out which are available and how they should be represented in the level editor.

{{{
(windstille-prefab
 (name "streetlamp")
 (sprite "images/objects/trashcan.sprite"
 (parameter (pos "vector") (image "sprite") ... ({Name} {Type}))
 (function "prefab_streetlamp"))
}}}
Name gives the name of the prefab, while sprite gives the sprite which should represent it in the editor. Parameter is a list of possible parameters that the prefab can have and which should be editable in the editor. Function is the scripting function which is called with the given parameter to create the prefab.

{{{
function prefab_streetlamp(params)
{
 // set trashcan_params and flies_params here according to what is set in params
 spawn_object("scriptable-objects", trashcan_params)
 spawn_object("flies", flies_params)
}
}}}
