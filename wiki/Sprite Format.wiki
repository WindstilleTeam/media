Sprite handle animation based on 2d images, they support using multiple images as frames as well as cutting the frames out of a single image.

{{{
 (sprite 
   (action
     (name "default")
     (speed 4.0)
     (images "foo/bar/frame1.png" "foo/bar/frame2.png")
     (offset 100 10))
 
   (action
     (name "run")
     (speed 15.0)
     (image-grid
       (file "human_turn.png")
       (x-size 98)
       (y-size 125))))
}}}

Other stuff from sprite which might not yet be implemented: 'Origin', alpha, color, pingpong, blendfunc, scale, vflip.
