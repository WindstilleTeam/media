==player.cpp==
FYI: I don't know if you are working on this at all, but if you are interested, i've change the two <code>-400</code> entries in the file <code>./src/player.cpp</code> to <code>-500</code>, so i can at least run-jump the stairs in the first demo level.<BR/>New code is...
<pre>
void
Player::set_jump_air()
{
  velocity.y = -500;
  sprite.set_next_action("JumpLandSofttoRun");
  state = JUMP_AIR;
}
</pre>
and
<pre>
void
Player::set_jump_up_air()
{
  velocity.y = -500;
  sprite.set_next_action("JumpLandSofttoRun");
  state = JUMP_UP_AIR;
}
</pre>
