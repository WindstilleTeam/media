''Some examples of things I'd like to do:''

Scripting integration/API, scripting, story, dialog, level design, perhaps the code for pushing and stacking boxes (but perhaps it would be better to leave this to whoever does collision detection/tilemap stuff), if neccessary perhaps code for other moveable game objects (cranes, cars, lifts, whatever)

''Something I might want to do if I understood exactly what was involved:''<br>

Add support for multiple sectors

''Some examples of things I could do if noone else wants to do them:''<br>

User input, control configuration

''Things I don't want to/can't do:''<br>

Art, sound, graphical effects, OpenGL stuff, tilemap stuff, dynamic player movement

Support for multiple sectors for the start simply means to implement a <tt>GameSession::set_sector(Sector* sector)</tt> or <tt>GameSession::set_sector(const std::string& sector)</tt> function and probally insert some code into the doors to handle the sector switch. Later on we might need a SectorManager or so that keeps track of the state of a sector, so that the sector doesn't get completly reset once you leave and reenter.
