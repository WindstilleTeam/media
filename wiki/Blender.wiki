There are plenty of ways to construct Blender models ({{{*.blend}}}) in a way that they don't work properly on other machines, this text shall give a little guideline on things to keep in mind.

== Textures

* The path to the texture must be relative, not absolute, this can be accomplished with the "Relative Path" option in the file dialog when selecting a texture
* Images must not be packed, the texture screen (Shift-F10) has a toggle button for that

== Armatures

<<note>>
How to accomplish that, is not yet clear.
<</note>>

Armatures and character models should stay seperate. 

== Lighting

Since the models are meant to be used in a game, all the lighting is the job of the game engine, not the {{{.blend}}} file. Model files should thus be free of light sources.

== Thumbnail Generation

A thumbnail generator for conforming Blender files can be found in  {{{trunk/blender-thumbnail/}}}.
