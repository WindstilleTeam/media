<quickflash> [13:00] <quickflash> grumbel: main issue with with unpacking is that images can't be relative I'm pretty sure

<grumbel_> quickflash: doesn't pressing the 'relative path' button help?

<quickflash> maybe, never noticed that button

<grumbel_> is in the load dialog

<grumbel_> when you load a image

<jamesg> So is it 18:00 GMT?

<grumbel> jamesg: yep

<jamesg> MazteB and godrin already said they couldn't make it, so I guess this is everyone who will be here

<grumbel> yep, think so

<jamesg> so what is up for discussion?

<quickflash> grumbel: are you logging

<grumbel> jamesg: good question :)

<grumbel> quickflash: unless my xchat crashes I will have a log

<jamesg> Opera can't log, which is dumb, maybe I should get a proper IRC client some time

<grumbel> line72, PauloMorfeo, straver: interesting in helping developing?

<line72> yes

<grumbel> line72: which area? graphics, prog, story, etc?

<jamesg> is WolfganB just logging?

<line72> mainly programming

<line72> some graphics (2d and 3d)

<straver> yes, but I ca't ufor two weeks

<grumbel> jamesg: not sure

<WolfgangB> ?

<line72> Its me and several others from our gamedev club are going to help out

<grumbel> WolfgangB: hi, wanna help too?

<WolfgangB> ther should be a log function somewhere

<quickflash> let

<jamesg> wolfgang, I just meant, are you really here or had you just left an IRC client connected to log the conversation whilst you went out. Obviousuly not.

<jamesg> So at least to start with we have quite a few people then.

<WolfgangB> grumbel, yes, i can do some programming. 

<grumbel> http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Jobs has some tasks available

<WolfgangB> okay, i learnd something about blender in lincity 

<WolfgangB> but it will look like the placeholder images :)

<quickflash> I'll work on animations and voices...

<grumbel> anybody interesting in writing a opengl based ttf font system?

<jamesg> are the clanlib fonts not good enough?

<quickflash> no system fonts in linux

<grumbel> jamesg: a) we might get rid of clanlib b) bitmap fonts are rather throuble some with multiple encodings

<straver> I'll most likely do some programming but I'll wait and see what tasks are left

<grumbel> the bitmap fonts are fine as long as one doesn't need a different fontsize or something different than latin1

<grumbel> past has however shown that sooner or later people always want to translate to non-latin1 languages

<line72> nehe has a tutorial on using freetype2 with opengl

<quickflash> yeah, thought I'd seen that before

--- grumbel has changed the topic to: Meeting at 18:00GMT - now

<grumbel> the ttf support is not really urgend, just some thing that we might need sooner or later, so if anybody wanna pick that task..

<jamesg> If someone wants to add support for non-European languages then fair enough, but given the amount of other work to do I don't think it's a priority

<WolfgangB> if there is voice-acting, localisation will be difficult alyway.

<grumbel> jamesg: it really depends if you switch away from clanlib, if we do, then it might be better to start with ttf renderer then doing a bitmap renderer

<grumbel> WolfgangB: simply switch voice acting off

<quickflash> ok, so let's talk about clanlib: use or don't use...

<line72> what's the option if we don't use it

<WolfgangB> oh, so voice is just reading on screen texts, no replacement for them?

<grumbel> line72: write stuff ourself & recycle supertux code

<grumbel> WolfgangB: yes

<jamesg> and recycle ClanLib code too, possibly?

<grumbel> jamesg: yep, that too

<line72> so, is this going to be 2d or 3d ?

<quickflash> mix

<line72> meaning we render everything in 3d, or we create 3d models, animated them, and generate 2d sprites from them ?

<grumbel> line72: tilemaps will be 2d, some sprites will be 2d and we will have 3d sprites, ie. simple meshes

<quickflash> 3d sprites will be used when it makes sense for memory

<grumbel> and when the graphic requires it

<grumbel> one thing are characters which will most likly be all 3d

<grumbel> other thing are stuff like cars or spaceships that might need to rotate to land/start

<straver> but that's easy in 2d withopengl anyway

<quickflash> yes, but then you get large textures

<jamesg> so what would be the advantage of leaving clanlib, other than reducing dependencies?

<WolfgangB> have a system you can understand in shorter time?

<grumbel> straver: the other two axes which are not z

<grumbel> straver: if you do that in 3d than you get *huge* texture

<grumbel> straver: 640x480 * 24 frames per second like

<jamesg> clanlib is no harder to understand than ano other library

<line72> my only issue with clanlib is we need the cvs version

<grumbel> line72: that IMHO a non-issue

<jamesg> the only change to clanlib cvs in the past week was a win32 makefile fix, by me. It doesn't change much, the issue is just that they haven't made a new release for ages.

<grumbel> the important parts go more into the direction of how hard is it to add shader support to clanlib

<grumbel> or how much of clanlib do we really need

<grumbel> jamesg: nothing clanlib fix is to change the near/far clipping planes from -1/1 to something larger, however not yet commited

<grumbel> anyway, thats more the kind of problems I expect if we stay with clanlib

<jamesg> Well, anyway, if we drop clanlib because it's easier for people writing graphics code then I won't complain, but I don't think we should rewrite a whole load of code just to reduce dependencies. There could be a new ClanLib release to coincide with Windstille, or otherwise just before release ClanLib could be copied into its own directory in Windstille.

<grumbel> jamesg: yep

<quickflash> clanlib release is just waiting for someone to do it...

<jamesg> so the decision on clanlib should be made by whoever it is who is coding graphics stuff?

<grumbel> jamesg: I would say we simply continue as we are and see if there is any clanlib left after a while

<jamesg> ok

<grumbel> ie. adding opengl based ttf font handling or switching tilemap to raw gl is all rather independed of clanlib

<jamesg> what other potentially controversial issues are there to discuss before we can discuss division of tasks?

<grumbel> question to all: have you actually played flashback or looked at least at the video in the "Similar Games" section in the wiki?

<grumbel> just so that everybody has a basic idea with what we start

<jamesg> I have played it briefly, so I know how it works.

<WolfgangB> no, i heard about the whole thing just yesterday

<quickflash> I couldn't get the avi to play

<grumbel> playing "Another World"/"Out of this World" and/or "Prince of Persia" might help as well

<line72> watching it now

<WolfgangB> i compiled windstille and looked at it, thats about it

<quickflash> prince of persia I recall

--> egore (~egore@vpn120.rz.uni-mannheim.de) has joined #windstille

<jamesg> to make the avi play open it up i na hex editor and change the two occurences of "FCMP" or whatever it is to "XVID"

<quickflash> rotoscoped animation

<grumbel> quickflash: flashback is basically the same, except you have a gun and you walk around in a city

<grumbel> quickflash: at least in some levels

<jamesg> I played the original prince of persia a bit, too

<grumbel> if somebody could explain me how to encode videos in linux that actually work that would be helpfull...

<grumbel> stuff that mplayer produces is seldomly usable 

<jamesg> encode them in a less advanced format - MPEG4 is all well and good but support varies

<jamesg> even after editing the second video it still crashes vlc

<WolfgangB> mplayer says "Video: no video" to the first one.

<egore> grumbel: kmenc15 or kino are quite helpfull

<WolfgangB> its working with xine. strange

<jamesg> it's because it uses the codec fourcc "FCMP" or something which is very new and most players don't yet realise that it is the same as MPEG4

<jamesg> but anyway, back to windstille

<grumbel> here a little screenshot: http://www.classicgaming.com/rotw/flash2.gif

<grumbel> anyway, point is windstille will have at least two basic modes

<grumbel> one will be that girl in normal cloth with realistic movement and abiliies

<jamesg> apparently I meant fmp4, not fcmp

<grumbel> the other will be girl in powersuit and thus more strength, faster, higher jumps, etc.

<grumbel> without the powersuit will be more or less an adventure mode, one where you walk around, buy stuff, talk to people 

<grumbel> maybe infiltrate some factory, sneak around and such

<grumbel> powersuit will be used outside of the city, on alien plants or in space

<grumbel> thats basically what we are aiming at

<grumbel> don't have much idea yet how the powersuit should play

<grumbel> something metroid-ish maybe, but then I don't like that jumps at all

<quickflash> metroidish

<WolfgangB> so its supertux with different graphics?

<grumbel> WolfgangB: nothing like supertux

<straver> I got the impression the game was supposed to be nonlinear

<grumbel> more like gta as sidescroller

<jamesg> So I take it the player will have a gun, but the gun will be flashback like (very slow rate of fire, time consuming to aim) than like metroid (hold down fire button)?

<grumbel> jamesg: in human mode definitivly

<jamesg> and in power suit mode too?

<straver> will the player be able to buy new weapons and upgrade the powersuit and so?

<grumbel> in powersuit mode I am not sure, but even there I would prefer something that is a lot less fast then metroid

<grumbel> something that gives you a realistic feel for the powersuit and not the ability to jump around like a flubber

<jamesg> if even in powersuit mode it will be quite slow paced, might it not be simpler if powersuit mode was a bit less different to normal mode than you are proposing? I.e., same control system, same basic gameplay style, just you cna jump higher and take more damage

<grumbel> straver: most likly

<grumbel> straver: however I am not so sure how much freedom is usefull there

<grumbel> jamesg: not sure, but powersuit should really feel different and more then just higher jumps

<jamesg> So what is the difference?

<grumbel> well, I want powersuit mode to be slower then metroid, but thats still a lot faster then flashback

<grumbel> so it might mean to take something like metroid controls and replace the spin-jump with something more realistic

<jamesg> so, ok, in power suit mode will you shoot bad guys by a) aiming a firing once or b) jumping on to a platform and holding down the fire button?

<grumbel> depends on the weapon I would say

<grumbel> ie. you could use a handgun or a bazooker style thing

<grumbel> depending on what the current mission offers

<jamesg> ok

<grumbel> powersuit mode might provide a auto-lock-on or so on enemies

<straver> and what control method are we going to use. I really like the abuse mouse/keyboard control.

<grumbel> definitvly not abuse like

<grumbel> I hate them

<grumbel> currently I am aiming for cursorkeys + wasd

<grumbel> so left/right -> walk

<grumbel> one button to run

<grumbel> one to use/talk

<straver> what's so bad with mouse aim? gives you more precision

<grumbel> one to draw the gun

<grumbel> straver: I don't like precision, it simply feels rather unnatural

<WolfgangB> gamepad support?

<grumbel> beside from that you don't need precision

<PauloMorfeo> (19:11:23) grumbel: Sorry, i was playing TA::Spring :P I don't expect to have enough time to do helping around this GOTM, unfortunatly... But i may do some things like voices if/when needed! (or something that doesn't require much time nor much learning to do)

<jamesg> So will we start off working on both game modes at once, or concentrate on just one to start with?

<grumbel> PauloMorfeo: ok

<grumbel> jamesg: starting with human mode I would say

<grumbel> since thats rather clear how it should look like

<grumbel> so first step would be to get the virtual environment ready, add doors, scripting, dialog

<grumbel> then start creating the city 

<jamesg> OK

<grumbel> and somewhere inbetween there toy around with powersuit tests

<jamesg> MazteB said he would do scripting?

<grumbel> jamesg: yep

<WolfgangB> grumbel, what language was planed for scripting?

<grumbel> its already in supertux and looks quite nice

<grumbel> WolfgangB: squirrel

<jamesg> it seems like we need scripting quite soon because lots of other stuff relies on it - e.g. I imagine doors will be implemented as scriptable objects? Is he going to do it soon?

<egore> WolfgangB: supertux uses it's own, afaik

<grumbel> he is currently playing around with openal

<grumbel> but scripting would be the next step

<grumbel> doors themself don't need scripting, a 'sector'  property would already be enough

<grumbel> egore: its squirrel in supertux

<egore> grumbel: ah, ok

<egore> grumbel: now that you mention it, I remember it :D

<line72> should we start assigning tasks ?

<PauloMorfeo> I supose it would be more like taking task onto self rather than assigning...

<WolfgangB> so whats the technical difference between windstille and supertux? Sounds more or less the same to me.

<grumbel> WolfgangB: well, technically its of course similar, gameplay wise however not

<egore> and supertux is more in direction of SDL, while windstille goes towards clanlib

<grumbel> graphically its a bit different since windstille supports lightmapping and 3d sprites

<PauloMorfeo> Grumbel: Is it suposed to scrool like SuperTux or to change screens like the old one... Forget it, i remember, it scrools!

<WolfgangB> would it be easier to change the gameplay in supertux than create something new?

<grumbel> PauloMorfeo: its supposed to scroll around, not screen switches

<grumbel> WolfgangB: no

<PauloMorfeo> Yes, i remember from playing that little demo!

<grumbel> http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-screenshot-2005-06-25-5.png

<grumbel> thats how windstille looks right now

<grumbel> on the right is a particle based fire

<grumbel> on the left a 3d sprite

<grumbel> in the middle a old 2d sprite

<grumbel> surrounded by light

<grumbel> the glow of the vr-tiles is a seperate highlight-layer

<grumbel> the different layers can be switched on and off via 1,2,3,4

<grumbel> about the 'story'/beginning of the game: game should start in a virtual environment where the player learns the basic movement

<grumbel> after that he leaves the VR, walk a bit around in his apartment, gets phonecall and is called over to a bar in the city

<grumbel> where he then gets the first mission assigned 

<quickflash> http://esoteric.clanlib.org/~khirsch/windstille/Run.avi

<quickflash> I think the head is coming down to fast when the front foot hits, what do you think?

<quickflash> grumbel: about the story... Think if you want voice acting, perhaps make the boss a guy

<quickflash> mainly because women voices are limited :)

<grumbel> quickflash: that run needs quite a bit more work, arm position is wrong, hands should be much higher

<grumbel> not enough up/down of the whole body 

<grumbel> and the leg makes an unnatural quick leap forward

<grumbel> and overall it needs more speed

<line72> hey, I have to run, is there a good place for me to get started with the code ?

<grumbel> line72: http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Jobs has some small tasks every once in a while

<line72> k, i'll play with the code tonight and see what I can do, later

<grumbel> just some more images: http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-shower.png

<grumbel> thats how the apartment will look like

<grumbel> thats how the subway might look like: http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-elevator.png

<grumbel> and this is url has basically all sketches around windstille: http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-files/

<grumbel> and here a whole bunch of random gameplay ideas: http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/puzzles.png

<grumbel> btw. one can zoom in and out with a/o in windstille at the moment

<grumbel> F10 toggles fps 

<grumbel> F11 toggles fullscreen

<grumbel> F12 screenshots

<grumbel> graphic engine also supports rotating the playfield

--> PauloMorfe1 (~Augusto@es-217-129-26-108.netvisao.pt) has joined #Windstille

<WolfgangB> is it possible to jump so hight that you reach the upper board?

<grumbel> however beside shaking the screen that might not be so usefull

<grumbel> WolfgangB: nope, but you can press left at startup then you land on the platform to the left

<grumbel> am planing to lowering/shrinking the platforms: http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-upjumpsketch.png

<-- PauloMorfeo has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))

<grumbel> so that you would be able to jump up and grab the ledge and pull yourself up

<grumbel> when human

--- PauloMorfe1 is now known as PauloMorfeo

<grumbel> anybody interested in implementing a quake-like console for windstille?

<grumbel> would be of little use at the moment, but once we have scripting such things can be extremly helpfull

<WolfgangB> i have not looked at the code much, but i'll give it a try

<WolfgangB> so i can't predict how long it will take to create the console.

<grumbel> there is currently a little-output only thing available

<WolfgangB> now linuxtag is over i'll find more time to do coding :)

<egore> WolfgangB: if MatzeB ports the sripting, you could use that for a console

<egore> WolfgangB: did I miss much today at linuxtag?

<WolfgangB> no. maybe i had just bed luck choosing the presentations, but most of them were not that interesting :(

<WolfgangB> but i got a community ticket  so I can't really complain. 

<egore> WolfgangB: hehe. Did you see the X.org presentation?

<WolfgangB> no, wrong plannig from Linuxtag there. x.org was in one of the smaller rooms, whe I arrived people where already standing in the doorways to watch the presentation.

<egore> like the Xen presentation ...

<egore> it started half an hour to early and the room could have been filled twice

<WolfgangB> but i looked at the exibition. x.org hat a nice demo with 4 videos plaing in transparent windows on the same desktop. another video as background.

<egore> right, that looked great :D

<WolfgangB> grumbel, Of course you missed the LinCity-NG meeting. 

<WolfgangB> ok, that was not an official event on linuxtag

<straver> bye

<-- straver has quit ("leaving")

<grumbel> ok, meeting official over, i'll post a log
