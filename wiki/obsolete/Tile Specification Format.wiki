The tile file, ie. the tile which defines which graphics are used for a tile, if the tile is collidable or not, etc., should support the following features:

* multi frame animated tiles
* TexCoord animated tiles (waterfall)
* multiple tiles per image
* efficent storage of tiles in OpenGL textures

They should not support:

* support for the different graphics layers (color/light/highlight) turned out to be more throuble then good so it got removed, instead you should be able to place a complete tilemap on the highlight layer.
 
Below is what we currently have, more or less, its far from final.
