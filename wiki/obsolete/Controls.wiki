Controls in Windtille will be configurable, this works by mapping keyboard keys, joystick buttons or whatever input device you have available to a virtual controller. This virtual controller will be more or less SNES like, meaning you have:

* a primary button, used for jumping or reloading
* a secondary button, used for running or shooting
* a tertiary button, used for using items
* a 'select' button, used to open the PDA/Inventory
* a aim button, used to switch between normal mode and shooting
* a pause button

When using the a keyboard this can be mapped as:

* 'wasd' for primary, secondary, tertiary and 'select'
* 'shift' for aim
* 'p' for pause
* 'cursorkeys' for steering
* 'enter' + 'escape' for confirm/cancel

Controls in general should be context sensitive meaning there don't necessarily is a hard mapping between a button and what you do, this could for example mean that the jump executed when you are standing infront of a ledge is a different one than when standing on normal ground or on the edge of a cliff or that when you walk against a wall you halt or when walking against a box you automatically start to push the box.

Controlls for powersuit and non-powersuit mode will be rather similar, except some details.

== Human without gun ==

* left/right: walk to the left or right
* down: duck
* down, left/right: sneak/crawl
* primary + up: jump up
* primary: jump forward
* secondary + left/right: run to the left or right
* tertiary: use nearest object
* aim: draw gun
* pda: show PDA

== Human with gun and aiming ==

* left/right: retreat or walk forward without turning around
* up/down: aim up or down
* secondary: shoot
* primary: reload
* tertiary: throw granate

== Additional 'modeless' Controls ==

* start/pause: pauses the game and shows the options menu (fullscreen/window mode, etc.)

== Open Questions ==

* Should drawing the weapon be a push&hold or a toggle? => should be configurable
* What about Turrican-style surround shooting? => can be done via aiming
* Is the three-mode style gun usage to complicated (pull, aim, shoot)? => yes, aiming should automatically draw the gun as well
