To get Windstille up and running you basically need these things:

== Subversion ==

http://subversion.tigris.org/
      
Description: A compelling replacement for CVS

== ClanLib 0.7 SVN  Version ==

It is available via:

{{{svn checkout https://clanlib.org/svn/ClanLib/Development/ClanLib-0.7 ClanLib-0.7}}}

This is required by the Flexlay level editor but not by Windstille itself. ClanLib itself also needs some additional libraries and programs to compile like pkg-config, libjpeg, libpng, libvorbis and some other things, however all those should come with your distro, so it shouldn't be to much trouble to install them. Check the [[http://www.clanlib.org/subversion.html|Official ClanLib Webpage]] for details.

== Flexlay SVN Version - Windstille's Level Editor ==

Flexlay is the editor that is used for Windstille, it is not required to run Windstille, but if you want to help develop it might prove rather useful, so it's recommended that you get it, it requires:

* the development version of ClanLib
* Ruby 1.8
* Swig 1.3.24
* [[http://www.scons.org|SCons]] (to build)

You can get it via:

 svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/flexlay/trunk/
