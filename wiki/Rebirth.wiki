Time to document a few things that went wrong in the past and how I intend to fix them.

== Tilemaps

While tilemaps are a classic building block of 2D games, they just didn't work out for what I had in mind. There is to much flexibility that is lost due to them and there are quite a few things that are made much harder, like slopes, AI reactions to the environment, etc.

How do I intend to fix this? The level in terms of graphics will be a series of textures quads that can be freely placed. The collision geometry on the other side will be a series of line segments. When a player walks he will follow those line segments instead of constantly checking a tilemap. This will lead to a kind of on-rails gameplay instead of a more freeform one. 

Some code for this is in place and availabe in a test application, it is not hooked up into the game.
