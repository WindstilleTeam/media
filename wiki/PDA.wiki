The PDA is a tool that can be used in the game to perform various functions, such as:

* recording dialog, so that it can be recalled later on
* record mission/quest logs
* detailed auto-map

When not in use the PDA should be in small form at the edge of the screen to provide a little automap, when activated it should pop-up and fill half the screen, while the player is visible on the other side, the game should continue to run when the PDA is activated. 

The PDA shall also act as communicator to call remote characters, the ship, the base or services.
