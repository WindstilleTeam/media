A Sector is a single room or scene.

== File Layout

Sectors are stored in {{{data/sectors/}}}, the main file is the {{{.wst}}} file, which defines the geometry and size of the sector. Scripts that are local shall be put in the same directory.

* {{{data/sectors/{SECTORNAME}/{SECTORNAME}.wst}}}
* {{{data/sectors/{SECTORNAME}/{SCRIPTNAME}.nut}}}

== Script Patch Syntax

{{{
(script "barrobot.nut") ;; Script relative to the location of the .wst file

(script "/scripts/barrobot.nut") ;; Script relative to the data directory

or 

(script "global:scripts/barrobot.nut") ;; Script relative to the data directory
}}}
