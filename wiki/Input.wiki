<<note>>
The input system has numerous unfinished features, since its mostly implemented on a 'as needed' basis.
<</note>>

The input system in Windstille offers plenty of ways of configuration and is implemnted in <<class>>InputManagerSDL<</class>>. Configuration files for multiple input devices are currently seperatly held from other configurations and can be found in {{{data/controller/}}}.

== Example

{{{
